The project aim was to design, develop, and prototype a 4-digit rotating LED electronic clock. This includes creating the electronic schematic, designing the PCB, selecting components, assembling the prototype, and testing its functionality. The goal is to deliver a fully operational clock with features like a rotating LED display, real-time etc
